# Dynamic-Hand-Recognition-Drawing-Program
A program that uses machine learning to detect hands from a streaming input from a camera and uses the location of the hand to draw on a whiteboard.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

This project was just a way for me to become more comfortable with machine learning, specifically with TensorFlow.
